title: Shelf

My Shelf is where I keep all the resources that have shaped my thinking. These are the books I return to again and again, plus talks, articles or tools that taught me something crucial. I started it as a private map so I wouldn't lose the good stuff, but the door is open so, help yourself! If even one piece here does for you what it did for me, that's all the thanks I need.

## Books
1. [Architecture Patterns with Python](https://amzn.to/456Crfw
): Every Python developer should read this at least once. Iâ€™ll keep recommending it until the day I retire. It lays bare the exact pitfalls every programmer eventually hits when they try to write code that lasts.
